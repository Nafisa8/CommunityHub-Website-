Use Case: Comment Submission
Users are expected to submit comments through a form on a profile page.
The PHP code checks if the submitted comment is empty. If it is, it displays an error message and provides a link to return to the profile page.
If the comment is not empty, it displays a success message and a link to return to the profile page.
The comment is inserted into a database table named commentTable.

Use Case: Profile Update
Users are expected to update their profile information (name and about) through a form on a profile edit page.
The PHP code checks if the submitted name and about fields are empty. If either is empty, it displays an error message and provides a link to return .
If both fields are filled, it displays a success message and a link to return to the profile edit page.
The name and about information are then inserted into a database table named profile_Table.
